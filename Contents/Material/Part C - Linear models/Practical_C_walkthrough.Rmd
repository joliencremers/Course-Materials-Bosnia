The following packages are required for this practical:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(mice)
library(ggplot2)
library(DAAG)
library(MASS)
```

The data sets `elastic1` and `elastic2` from the package `DAAG` were obtained
using the same apparatus, including the same rubber band, as the data frame
`elasticband`. 

1. **Using a different symbol and/or a different color, plot the data
from the two data frames `elastic1` and `elastic2` on the same graph. Do the two
sets of results appear consistent?**

```{r}
elastic <- rbind(elastic1, elastic2)
elastic$source <- c(rep("Elastic1", nrow(elastic1)), 
                    rep("Elastic2", nrow(elastic2)))

elastic %>%
  ggplot(aes(stretch, distance, colour = source)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "green"))

```

The results seem very consistent: Data set `elastic2` has more observations over a larger range, but both sets result in roughly the same regression line. Data set `elastic1` seems to have an *odd-one-out* value.

---

2. **For each of the data sets `elastic1` and `elastic2`, determine the regression of
distance on stretch. In each case determine:**

- fitted values and standard errors of fitted values and
- the $R^2$ statistic.

Compare the two sets of results. What is the key difference between the two sets
of data?

First we run the two models:
```{r}
fit1 <- 
  elastic1 %$%
  lm(distance ~ stretch)

fit2 <- 
  elastic2 %$%
  lm(distance ~ stretch)
```

and then we compare the fitted values
```{r}
fit1 %>% predict(se.fit = TRUE)
fit2 %>% predict(se.fit = TRUE)
```
We see that `fit1` (based on `elastic1`) has a larger residual standard deviation (i.e. `$residual.scale`). 

To get the $R^2$ we can run a summary on the fitted models:
```{r}
fit1 %>% summary()
fit2 %>% summary()
```

Or we can grab the $R^2$ directly from the object without a pipe
```{r}
summary(fit1)$r.squared
summary(fit2)$r.squared
```
The model based on `elastic2` has smaller standard errors and a much larger $R^2$.
This is due to the larger range of values in `elastic2`, and the absence of an outlier.

---

3. **Study the *residual vs leverage* plots for both models. Hint use `plot()` on the fitted object**

```{r}
fit1 %>% plot(which = 5) #the fifth plot is the residuals vs leverage plot
fit2 %>% plot(which = 5)
```

For `elastic1`, case 2 has the largest influence on the estimation. However, it is not the case with the largest residual:
```{r}
fit1$residuals
```

As we can see, case 7 has the largest residual.

---

Because there is a single value that influences the estimation and is somewhat different than the other values, a robust form of regression may be advisable to obtain more stable estimates. When robust methods are used, we refrain from omitting a suspected outlier from our analysis. In general, with robust analysis, influential cases that are not conform the other cases receive less weight in the estimation procedure then under non-robust analysis.

---

4. **Use the robust regression function `rlm()` from the `MASS` package to fit lines to the data in `elastic1` and `elastic2`. Compare the results with those from use of `lm()`:**

- residuals
- regression coefficients, 
- standard errors of coefficients, 
- plots of residuals against fitted values.

First, we run the same models again with `rlm()`
```{r}
fit1.rlm <- 
  elastic1 %$%
  rlm(distance ~ stretch)

fit2.rlm <- 
  elastic2 %$%
  rlm(distance ~ stretch)
```

and then we look at the coefficients and the residuals
```{r}
data.frame(lm = coef(fit1), 
           rlm = coef(fit1.rlm))

data.frame(lm = coef(fit2), 
           rlm = coef(fit2.rlm))
```

We see that the coefficients for `elastic1` are different for `lm()` and `rlm()`. The coefficients for `elastic2` are very similar. 

To study the standard errors of the coefficients:
```{r}
data.frame(lm = summary(fit1)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"], 
           rlm = summary(fit1.rlm)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"])

data.frame(lm = summary(fit2)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"], 
           rlm = summary(fit2.rlm)$coefficients[, "Std. Error"])
```

The standard errors for the estimates for `elastic1` have become much smaller with `rlm()` compared to standard `lm()` estimation. The standard errors for `elastic2` are very similar. 

To study the residuals:
```{r}
data.frame(lm = residuals(fit1), 
           rlm = residuals(fit1.rlm))

data.frame(lm = residuals(fit2), 
           rlm = residuals(fit2.rlm))
```

The residual trend for both models is very similar. Remember that different values will still be different under robust analyses; they are only given less influence. 

---

To plot the residuals against the fitted values:
```{r}
plot(fit1, which = 1, add.smooth = "FALSE", col = "blue", main = "elastic1")
points(residuals(fit1.rlm) ~ fitted(fit1.rlm), col = "orange")

plot(fit2, which = 1, add.smooth = "FALSE", col = "blue", main = "elastic2")
points(residuals(fit2.rlm) ~ fitted(fit2.rlm), col = "orange")
```

The case 2 residual in elastic1 is smaller in the robust regression. This is
because the case had less weight in the `rlm()` estimation of the coefficients than
in the ordinary `lm()` regression.


---

5. **Use the `elastic2` variable `stretch` to obtain predictions on the model fitted on `elastic1`.**

```{r}
pred <- predict.lm(fit1, newdata = data.frame(stretch = elastic2$stretch))
```

---

6. **Now make a scatterplot to investigate similarity between plot the predicted values against the observed values for `elastic2`**
```{r}
new.dat <- data.frame(stretch = elastic2$stretch, 
                      distance = c(elastic2$distance, pred))

new.dat$source <- c(rep("original", nrow(elastic2)), 
                    rep("predicted", nrow(elastic2)))

new.dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(stretch, distance, colour = source)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The predicted values are very similar to the observed values:
```{r}
data.frame(distance = elastic2$distance, predicted = pred) %>%
  ggplot(aes(distance, predicted)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)
  
```

They do not strictly follow the straight line because there is some modeling error: we use `elastic1`'s model to predict `elastic2`'s distance [error source 1] and we compare those predictions to `elastic2`'s observed distance [error source 2]. However, if you consider the modeling, these predictions are very accurate and have high correlations with the observed values:
```{r}
data.frame(distance = elastic2$distance, predicted = pred) %>%
  cor() 
```

The mammalsleep dataset is part of `mice`. It contains the Allison and Cicchetti (1976) data for mammalian species. To learn more about this data, type
```{r}
?mammalsleep
```

--- 

7. **Fit and inspect a model where `brw` is modeled from `bw`**
```{r}
mammalsleep %$%
  lm(brw ~ bw) %>%
  anova()
```
It seems that we can model brain weight `brw` with body weight `bw`. If we inspect the linear model, we see that the $R^2$ is quite high:
```{r}
mammalsleep %$%
  lm(brw ~ bw) %>%
  summary()
```

---

8. **Now fit and inspect a model where `brw` is predicted from both `bw` and `species`**
```{r}
mammalsleep %$%
  lm(brw ~ bw + species) %>%
  anova()
```

There seems to be a perfect fit and we don't get any p-values. If we inspect the linear model `summary()`, we find that every animal only is observed once. Adding species as a predictor yields the most overfitted model we may obtain and our residuals drop effectively to zero. 

```{r}
mammalsleep %$%
  lm(brw ~ bw + species) %>%
  summary()
```

The analysis we ran is in fact equivalent to running a fixed effects model on clusters of size 1. Since in that scenario there is no clustering, we should omit the fixed effect for `species` and just model the random variation (in this case done by the residual variance).

---

9. **Can you find a model that improves the $R^2$ in modeling `brw`?**

Since we're considering linear models so far, I limit myself to linear models only. The basis of the linear model is the variance covariance matrix and how it translates to data relations. This is most easily linearly summarized in the correlation matrix:
```{r}
mammalsleep %>%
  subset(select = -species) %>% #exclude factor species
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs") #pairwise deletion
```

This matrix contains quite a few cells. To obtain only the correlations with `brw` we could select the respective column:
```{r}
mammalsleep %>%
  subset(select = -species) %>% #exclude factor species
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs") %>% #pairwise deletion
  subset(select = brw) #only column brw from the correlation matrix
```

It seems that the following variables have a rather nice relation with `brw`:

- `sws`: short wave sleep
- `ts` : total sleep
- `mls`: maximum life span
- `gt` : gestation time
- `sei`: sleep exposure index

However, from the larger correlation matrix we can also see that `ts` is highly colinear with `sws` - in fact, `ts` is calculated as the sum over `sws` and `ps`. Including both variables will not hurt our $R^2$ per se, but it will certainly trouble the precision of our estimation as including both variables will yield much larger standard errors. It may be wise to select `sws` as a predictor: `ts` contains a source of *error* in the form of `ps`, so its linear association with `brw` is slightly weaker. However, `sws` misses 14 cases and `ts` misses only 4. 
```{r}
mammalsleep %>%
  summary()
```

Therefore it is highly preferable to use `ts` in the model, despite its weaker association.

We run the new model:
```{r}
fit <- 
  mammalsleep %$%
  lm(brw ~ bw + ts + mls + gt + sei)
  
fit %>%
  summary()
```
and we have obtained a very high $R^2$. If prediction was our goal, we are doing great.

---

10. **Inspect the diagnostic plots for the model obtained in `exercise 12`. What issues can you detect?**
```{r}
fit %>%
  plot(which = 1:6)
```

Some issues spring to mind:

- There error variance seems to be heteroscedastic [but we have a rather small sample]
- The residuals are not normally distributed in the extreme tails
- The following case has a large leverage: 1
- The following case has large residual: 5
```{r}
mammalsleep$species[c(1, 5)]
```

If we sort the `brw` variable together with its strongest predictor 
```{r}
mammalsleep %>% 
  subset(select = c(species, brw, bw, ts, mls, gt, sei)) %>%
  arrange(desc(brw)) #sort the data in descending order based on brw
```

we see that `Man` has a large `brw` for small `bw` and that `African elephant` is so large that it massively influences the model. For `Man` we would expect a much lighter brain given its body weight. We can also see this from the residuals:
```{r}
fit %>%
  residuals()
```

from the influence statistics:
```{r}
fit %>%
  influence()
```
From the influence we see:

- the residual standard deviation `$sigma` would drop when the first case and the fifth case would be omitted.
- the coefficients `$coefficients$ would dramatically change if cases 1 and 5 were omitted

The `influence(fit)$coefficients` is equivalent to the `dfbeta()` return:
```{r}
head(influence(fit)$coefficients)

fit %>%
  dfbeta() %>%
  head()
```
