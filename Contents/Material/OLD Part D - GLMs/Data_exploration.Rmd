1. Download the benefits data from the course webpage. Note that this data is in .xlsx format. Try to load this data into R using the function `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package (remember to specify the correct path/set your working directory accordingly)

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel("Benefits.xlsx")

```

2. Get a subset of the individuals that had more than 10 years of tenure and lost their job because the position was abolished. Hint: use `subset()` and pipes from the `dplyr` package.
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
data %>% subset(tenure > 10 & joblost == "position_abolished")

```

3. Further explore the dataset, make plots, summaries, check values, etc.
